## Balance Sheet
- Balance Sheet Equation
    - Double-entry bookkeeping
    - Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' Equity
        - Stockholders' Equity = Contributed Capital + Retained Earnings
        - Retianed Earnings = Prior Retained Earnings + Net Income - Dividends
        - Net Income = Revenues - Expenses

- Assets
  - Must be acquired in the past and can be valued with reasonble degree of precision
  - Examples: cash, account receivable, inventory, prepaid rent, land
 
- Liabilities
  - Must be based on benefits/services received in the past; Amount and timimg of payment must be reasonably certain
  - Examples: account payable, tax payable, salaries payable, notes/interest payable
 
- Stockholders' Equity

  - Sources:
    - contributed capital: common stock par value, additional paid-in-capital (exess over par), treasury stock (repurchased stocks)
